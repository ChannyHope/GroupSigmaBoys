                            <p>‘Sigma male’ might not be a term that you recognize, but you’re pretty likely to recognize the characteristics of one – either in a friend or in yourself!

                                Most of us make snap judgements about alpha males (arrogant and extroverted) and beta males (shy and introverted), even though these are not always accurate.
                                
                                But what about sigma males? What sets them apart?
                                
                                Simply put, you wouldn’t be able to pinpoint a sigma male straightaway.
                                
                                They’re not the type to peacock around, nor are they likely to be pressed into a corner pretending not to exist.
                                
                                They tend to just be happy being themselves and getting on with their own thing, which means they don’t really stand out.
                                
                                Imagine a scale of personalities – alphas are one end of the spectrum and are easy to identify; betas are at the other end and, much as they try to hide, they’re pretty easy to spot.
